{"text": "Hello everyone. It's Ollie here. It's race week in Singapore. Generally, I'm not really that much of a morning person, but I've got it on good authority that the mornings in Singapore are the best. So, today we're going to go for a ride around the gardens. [Music] So, I guess a bit of backstory as to why we're here so early. You know, it's Monday morning here in Singapore. Generally, we don't arrive at the track or even in the country for a race until at least Wednesday. Um, but this is one of the places that it's really important to arrive a bit earlier just because the climate is is very difficult. I've never raced here, but I was here last year as a reserve driver, and the conditions were incredibly humid, incredibly hot, and yeah, I just really wanted to make sure I'm here nice and early so I can train, get used to that humidity and acclimatize well. So, yeah, trying to get here early is is super super important. [Music] I'm here with my girlfriend this year and we were speaking about it for a very long time that that she should come to Singapore. Last night we we went straight to the sate street to have lots of satÃ© chicken and uh yeah, now it's my first full day. It's really nice to be up in the morning. As as much as I hate to say it, the weather's much cooler and also there's a lot less people out in the morning. This is an interesting race because normally you try to stay on European time. Uh because it's a night race, it means that you stay up incredibly late. You're going to bed at like 3 or 4:00 a.m. waking up at uh midday, I would say. So, it means that this is my first time actually seeing a sunrise in Singapore because last year I I wasn't waking up before lunchtime. Oh my goodness. That is incredible. I really want to swim in the water now. Looks refreshing. [Music] So, it's been really nice to have a look around the city. You know, normally when we come to a race, we're not actually going anywhere else than the track and the hotel. So, coming here a bit early and seeing what the city has to offer is a really nice experience. And now I think it's time for breakfast. So, all the cycling was hungry work. Uh, so now it's time for breakfast. We got ourselves a bit of a mix here. Some typical breakfast that I would eat, but also some fusion food. I'm going to try and guess what it is. We definitely have some dumplings. I guess pork dumplings. One of my favorite dishes here. Then after that, I would guess this is something like French toast. >> Kaya toast. >> So this is kaya toast. French toast with coconut jam. After that, we have what looks like waffles. Great. The sauce smells like a curry of some sort. That's an interesting mix. Waffles with curry. And finally, some noodles. What is it called? >> Stoam. Stoam. Guess >> I guess I guess it's fruit. This looks good actually. Strawberry with banana. >> I will start with the dumpling. A little spicy, but good. Oh my god. Probably not very spicy, but for me, too spicy. So, next I'm going to try the sto ayam. Is it spicy? I should probably check now. [Music] Quite nice. So, what is the soup? Is it like a beef a chicken broth >> stock? Okay. >> Oh, it's very nice. >> Really? I can't rank them. >> Okay, before I get carried away, I'm going to try this. Normally, I have waffles with uh with maple syrup or honey, but curry is a is a new one. So, how do I do this? I hope it's not spicy. Probably [Music] trusting. Nothing good or bad. I think for now I'll stick with my maple syrup on on the waffle. I need to be careful not to eat too much since the food is very tasty. Is this egg yolk? I think it is. It looks amazing. I guess this one isn't spicy, right? Oh my gosh, that is incredible. >> Try it with the >> thumbs up. >> Best so far. Oh, here we are. >> You excited about your first race? >> Yeah, I'm incredibly excited. I always enjoy driving on street tracks and Singapore is is one of the most famous. I think it's the first night race um back when it was first introduced. So, a lot of history here at this circuit and yeah, I really enjoyed the city last year. So, you know, returning and actually driving this year is going to be incredibly fun. Now, back to the eating. >> Is this Is it spicy? >> It's like an orange juice extract or something. It's pretty good. Okay, before I eat the whole table, Martin will kill me. So, I heard there's an infinity pool. I didn't get to try it out last year. Weather looks pretty good. So, should we go for a swim? Too late. [Music] It's amazing. I mean, the view is incredible. Probably the best swimming view that I've ever seen. Um, yeah, I really love swimming. It's uh good training, although I'm very bad. My mom is quite good, but I didn't inherit those jeans. >> Looks like we have some visitors. Hello. >> Hello. >> You want to take a picture? >> Yes. Yes. You ready? >> Ah, it's here. >> Now we should do a race. You ready? >> Okay. >> Three, two, one, go. >> Go, go, go. You're all very fast. >> You won. I came last. >> Splash. Splash. >> You're crazy. We race. We do a proper race this time. Three. >> Go one. One step ahead on. >> One step ahead. Okay. Three. >> Two. One. >> You're fast. Very fast. What if I splash you? >> It's a draw. We're all playing fast. Good race. >> I'm looking for >> Should we go grab some juice now? >> Oh, okay. >> Let's go. Brace you. >> What? So, we're here having a quick juice and I think that you guys have some questions for me, right? >> Go ahead. >> Does wind blow on your face when you drive the F1 car? >> So, no, the wind doesn't blow on my face cuz we have the helmet and the >> your face. >> It covers our face. Yeah. So, we we feel the wind, but it doesn't go on my face, luckily. When did you start working? >> Working? Well, I guess >> only this year. This is my first year in Formula 1. So, I guess that's the first year working. >> What about if the car is too fast? >> Then we are really happy. If the car is really fast, it's never too fast. But if it's fast, we are we have a big smile. >> Why are we so fast until we bang into someone? >> We try not to bang into the other people, but sometimes it happens. That's uh that's part of the racing, but we try not to. These are some incredible questions. So, it was lots of fun up here swimming, but I think now it's time to relax with a massage. >> One more. [Music] >> So, now is the part that I'm the most scared about, which is a foot massage. I don't know who signed me up for this, but um I'm nervous cuz I'm probably the most ticklish person that I know, I guess. Yeah, I'm I'm in trouble. Hello. Nice to meet you. >> You can put your feet inside the door. >> Okay. >> Sorry, I'm just to let you know, I'm I'm a bit ticklish, so if I laugh, it's it's not your fault. It's just that I'm really ticklish. >> Sorry. Sorry in advance. It's not too bad. I feel so bad because I'm so sorry for laughing. I have to try to focus now. >> Sorry. Okay. Actually, it's really nice. Oh, my my shins are so tight. Yeah, that's >> that's really tight, but it's good. I should stretch more. >> Oh, this is teaching me one thing that my my legs are really tight. I need to stretch more. It's my second time in Singapore, but it almost feels like my first time. Um, because last year when I came, I I didn't really get to enjoy the city. You know, I was arriving at the last minute and leaving straight away. So, now actually getting to enjoy the city, see the beautiful sightes, enjoy the hotel a lot more as well because last time I was just really sleeping uh and leaving again. So, I really, really enjoyed it and I'm excited for the week ahead, especially the race. Oh my god. That's not ticklish. That's painful. But it should be painful. >> Did you tell her to go shunga? I can't do it. [Music] Okay. Sorry. Uh, this must be [Music] Sorry. I'm so sorry. Ah, did you hear that? >> Oh my god. [Music] >> No, no, it's okay. >> Okay, finished. Finished with the left. Okay, so that was Okay, so that was my morning here at Marina Bay Sands. I think I'm converted to a morning person now. It was a great morning and I'm excited for the rest of the week here in Singapore. See you next time. Cut. >> Oh, thank God. >> Now I can do my re normal reaction. >> Oh, it's bad, right? >> Oh my god. You >> You cut, right?"}
