  "text": "do you think men can give birth I think that uh yes or no question I think that a person who is assigned male at Birth I don't think they a signed male at Birth so people are not male at Birth I think that a person see your evidence that college is a scam my friend so what do you say in some cases women without your these are murderers of course not they're not murderers we the difference between an IUD killing a conceived zygote and like a mother going to Planned Parenthood and killing the petus in her room that was actually the best point somebody made it's not about the the cells it's not about no no no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking hello everyone I am Charlie Kirk founder of Turning Point USA and uh I am surrounded by 20 woke college kids my first prompt is abortion is murder and should be [Music] illegal all right can I maybe go okay hello what's your name Juliana nice to meet you nice to meet you can we get our terms right first yeah okay abortion is the forcible ending of the viability of a being in utero otherwise known as a fetus do we agree that's what abortion is okay yeah okay great and then murder is the intentional taking of Life different than killing or sudden death so murder would be the intent with intent taking another life do we agree with that okay okay and then we agree that murder in general in society should be illegal yeah okay great so yeah no I do want to preface that I'm a Catholic so I think one really important thing that the Bible says is to not judge and just going back to the topic um I think there's a big difference uh between you know cells in utero than a living breathing existing being and while um I do believe it's murder and that's just my personal belief right I don't believe in telling people what to do with their bodies that's not up to me and it's not up to us as well as Christians to judge should we prevent murder in society for sure yeah I should be illegal but I think that it's really different right because you know these people aren't sorry nice to meet you okay nice to [Music] meet okay what's your name NAA nice to meet you okay can I just ask um at how many weeks do you think that a fetus is V viable well viability and moral worth are two different things no but I'm asking you at how many weeks do you 20 weeks a baby can survive outside of utero so it's actually 24 to 26 weeks 20 the youngest ever in a niku unit actually happened in San Diego not far from here and Sur survived at 20 weeks okay so under roie Wade 93% of abortions happened in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy that's 93% of the abortions happened well before a fetus is technically viable as a form of let's go into VI ability so what is it about let's say a six week baby that has a heartbeat its own DNA fingerprint brain waves that is less moral worth than an 88-year-old right now with dementia in a home down the street that person requires assistance requires help what why is it that the six week baby is of less moral worth well first of all it's not a baby it's a fetus what does fetus mean a fetus is in utero what does fetus mean in Latin what the I'm sorry is this a it means little human being his smile is very creepy okay um smiling is creepy no your smile specifically but let's go back to we're losing track here no but but is what species is the fetus the fetus is not a species yet it's technically classified as a parasite until it is viable now I want to talk I can't really get past that are you saying you saying a baby is a disease or a tumor a parasite is not a disease and a tumor those are not the same thing a parasite is defined as something that cannot survive outside its host a baby before it is viable cannot survive outside of a woman's womb got it so let's let's extrapolate that is not a living organism are are old people with Alzheimer's and Dementia that are being assisted every day are they parasites no they're not parasites they're human beings who are on the brink of death got it so my going my four-month-old that requires mom's breast milk and requires daily changes and feedings cannot survive without its own is my four-month-old the parasite your baby can breathe on its own your baby can drink water from its mouth to its stomach but but it canot your bab can eat can it hunt can it gather can it reason but that's not what qualifies something as being a living organism being a living organism simply means can you survive outside of a womb outside of your host got it so I just want to make sure I'm clear why does that then equate to moral viability it equates to Scientific viability why under what standard because it is not alive and you are advocating for the rights of something that is not technically a life got it so what is is something while sacrificing the needs of the human woman who is alive got it so but a a a mom can survive yes without the baby in her uhuh right yes the baby cannot survive without the mom yes but a mom cannot survive without her lungs so it's not her body it's in her body it's not her DNA so it's not her choice so it's a it actually is directly her DNA it's it is 100% it's 50% of her DNA after DNA he's going to win I'm telling you this this this this could take a while okay first of all do we have our terms correct we agree actually no so first of all I'd like to refine our terms I have two points to bring up after that though so you Define murder is like intentionally like killing a human being I think that's a very poor way to Define murder because if someone were to like break into my home and point a gun at the heads of me and everybody I love and I intentionally kill them to prevent them from un from killing my family I don't think I murdered them right so I would Define murder as the unjustified termination of a human life you're making a good point let me further clarify then so self-defense is very warranted exactly right but I I can see where you're going to go with how that has to go with abortion but we can go down that journey in a second yeah so I mean like I I kind of do want to give you my argument and so far as why I'm pro-choice why I think it's Justified but first I think that you know your position is quite absurd right because you're saying that it is murder to kill a human being right at any point in development especially when it's in the mother's wom my question to you would be well does this make women with iuds murderers because it is the case that in some scenarios an IUD will allow for conception to occur meaning there's a unique human life there but it will prevent its implantation intentionally killing it well no preventing implantation is not necessarily the same thing as terminating a fertilized egg for example if you take Plan B for again it's not it's not the same thing preventing the production of proest progesterone is not the same thing as terminating a fully a a being that has been fertilized you do not know for a fact that the egg has been fertilized you do not know that when even IUD okay yeah so preventing a fertilization or implantation to the uter lining is killing a conceived zygote so what happens a sperm goes into the egg right the egg becomes fertilized it's a conceived zygote in some cases it will prevent the implantation of the conceived zygote killing the conceived zygote in some cases correct so what do you say in some cases women are murderers of course not they're not murders we do not know for a case that's that's like saying that every so what's the difference between an IUD killing a conceived zygo like a mother going to plann Parenthood and killing the fetus in her room well so you asking you're asking two separate things if they if they knew for certain to be more clear that I have a fertilized egg and I'm going to take a drug to prevent that fertilized egg from attaching to their uterin wall then yes that is an act of killing or murder of course okay so do you think all murderers should go to jail do I think all murderers should go to jail I mean on the third on third degree murder however no I don't think women that got abortions or had iuds should go to jail because I think that they have been deceived by mass culture M Mass propaganda secondly the people who should go to jail are the abortionists who are the ones that have been putting the abortion pill the ones that have been doing procedures the ones that have been going into the third trimester and breaking babies backs and inserting them with syringes while the babies are crying and suffocating being born alive and then being dead on the operating table that is who should go to jail oh that was actually the best point somebody made we'll have to we'll have to talk about [Music] it okay whenever I'm talking about this discussion um I always go to the question of what about in The Case of the mother when her life is in danger because I'm a big believer I don't I don't know I'm still iffy on if I think it's a or if it's murder or not but even so I mean I don't want to say murder is Justified guys wait let me just get this one point and then you can vote me out give me one second um say the mother gets pregnant and she knows that if she gives birth she's going to die she has some kind of Health complication then what do you do in section I don't know what that means to C-section they an ins guys wait hold on give me one second go right they go right below the belly button and they deliver the baby and therefore she doesn't have to give birth it's technically birth but it's much safer so that's that's actually safer than an abortion procedure sorry sorry [Music] Lily hello how are you hi what's your name Deen nice to meet nice to meet you um I would say with abortion I think uh it's it's very complicated but I think the issue that I have primarily with your stance of being pro-life that there's no Nuance um there's women who are being forced to travel hundreds of miles to access abortion care even in cases of rape in certain States that're they're not giving any sort of um allowance for that and I think um you know a lot of people who are pro-life they they say that they're pro-life but I feel like they're really Pro birth because in you know with Firearms uh the United States has some of the highest firearm deaths um out of oecd Nations right and we can acknowledge that that's for children who are actually living in um so I feel like abortion while yeah it is I can I can definitely see your point I I just think that it should be allowed in some circum yeah great um I'm happy to get into the gun violence stuff later but I want to really stay focused on abortion right you can see you can say you see my point can you see the world also where since we know it's a human life that it should be illegal since we don't allow murder in our society well that's that's that's where I have an issue because abortion is not being done willy-nilly it's it's like the life of the mother's always how many abortions do you think we have every day in America guess I'm not sure I'm not sure guess I I'm I'm honestly not sure maybe I don't know a th000 4,000 a day so it is kind of willy-nilly we have 1.6 [Music] sorry hello hi um I just want to clarify the thing that you're aiming for is less abortion right that would be you would want or at least eventually it's also a protection of those that can't protect themselves but yes and that's why once we after the reversal of Row versus Wade we saw abortions go down dramatically in Texas Alabama Mississippi we saw thousands of babies that are now alive and well that are able to have amazing lives thanks to the reversal of Row versus weight uh I don't think a lot of that is true um it is but it's not true because when you make abortion illegal it doesn't actually decrease the amount of ab a nice talking point in Texas the numbers show differently birth has gone up yeah legal goes down but illegal abortions still happen abortions still happen outside of whatever data you're show that's not true but let's just say so 40% so well if you if you want to well first of all if you count the abortion pill you're right but that's a separate thing than a chemic chemical abortion and surgical abortion different things and I'm not debating I'm not I'm not debating you I'm debating her so if you want to do the flags and come back in try and be faster next time so let me ask you this so the question is we should try to limit unjust suffering of human beings right sure okay that's my position is that there's unjust suffering of anywhere between 1.4 to 1.6 million abortions a year of human beings that are being massacred in the womb and so that's not a woman's rights issue that's not a men's rights issue that's just a human rights issue okay the best way to decrease abortions happening is proper sex education limiting abortion and making abortion illegal does not actually decrease the amount of abortions that happen so what is your evidence of that what is my evidence of that because we have increased sex education last 30 years we've had no our sex education is so bad in America well by bad what do you mean by that we have we have more access to birth control for young kids we have more kids that are learning you birth control at a younger age we have more of that in our public school system and we've seen all the trends actually go in a negative Direction so in fact we see that the more sex exucation there is the the more disturbing those Trends are so you say that let me ask just one more thing you say that if we make abortion illegal people will still do it should we then just make gang violence legal because no I'm saying if you actually wanted to decrease the amount of abortions that happen you wouldn't be advocating for a like to make abortion illegal you'd be advocating for Alles that logic apply to stealing looting kidnapping ARS sin and murder well actually it does because those are results of different societal issues that you should be educating yourself on rather than making ital front can we should we make kidnapping arson burgly murder legal because they're symptoms of something else we should be helping Society heal from those things got answer the question we want less of those things so we just make them legal will get less looting you know actually I'm going to let someone else thank you very much [Music] hi Parker nice to meet you yes nice to meet you Charlie big Tick Tock guy here so like uh pedophiles people who were married to children in the past and normalized in that Society should they go to prison should pedophiles like if you could go back in time would you put those pedophiles in prison that was that married those children because it was normalized they were deceived into thinking it's okay would you put them in prison you had to slow down file should get the death penalty no so you'd go back in the past you give them the death penalty even though they were deceived into thinking it was okay but you said people who get abortions who are women shouldn't go to pris but it's not currently illegal okay regardless at that time at that time it wasn't no I would not go back and retroactively enforce laws where things were currently not illegal you wouldn't put pedophiles in prison in the past hold on a second when was it ille when was it legal in America well child marriage was legal in America throughout the early 1900s and especially throughout most of society for thousands of years especially in the Old Testament and in the Bible hold well hold on hold on a second so where where where is the levitical law that allows you to marry a child oh yeah can you name the verse so well I can't name the first but the particular conditions that are enlisted in the Bible are that you have to beat physical maturity and emotional maturity which is extremely vague and throughout Society has been seen there is not a verse but let's kind of go back back under your VI let's go back to well generally agreed upon it's 18 years old but let me ask you but you but you because you you don't go based on what's General you go based on the b i I say 18 years old but let me ask you a question where's when when does Life Begin conception like conception great so good so should we protect our life at conception I care about Senti in life not not so when do brain waves start you think brain dead people should be able to pull the plug on like family should be able to pull the plug on individual got to answer the question when do brain when do brain waves when do brain waves start uh you can see brain waves around 6 to 8 weeks which in brain dead individual there are brain waves as well so the brain waves necessary to produce a subjective experience are met until around 2 can you see it from my perspective that at six to eight weeks those brain waves will actually increase not decrease if allowed the process of development to continue did you know those same EEG scans exist in brain dead people that you don't think are the difference with the brain dead people is that the likelihood of those brain waves actually increasing is very low at 6 to eight weeks when by 15 weeks they can hear the it's irreversible sensation that's what brain death is I know that it's not coma but you're you're you're doing a red herring go back to it's not what's a red herring six a red herring is where you you avoid the topic and you say something that is uh adjacent or symmetrical to what I'm saying but not actually I'm saying me that's not that's not a red herring a six to8 week baby if they're allowed to continue to develop what ends up happening uh at a certain point it will become a sentient being in the future the same way if I keep engaging with my girlfriend there'll be a baby in the future yet I don't care about unless you're infertile which we don't know but so let's let's see let's see the the process of development right why answer my question why do you have the ability or the right should those child P3 go to prison the process of should the pedophiles Go to Prison from 1904 how many pedophiles are alive from 1904 they're not alive right I meant like if you can go back in the past hypothetically speaking and you could put them in prison would you put them in prison I would have killed them myself if I was aive back okay so then so then you don't apply it based upon what people are deceived to believe you apply based on what you consider think should whys CL constructive debate if you keep on talking over me I was finishing my statement you were talking over me let me ask you a very simple question do you think it would be a good thing if we had less abortions in America um it depends on the context like are the abortions prior to sentience yes all abortions yeah no it would not be necessarily better unless it is the case of the people didn't want the abortions and it would be negatively impactful to their health medically speaking L abortion uh after sentience yes okay so you you believe in an 8we abortion ban yeah no no no I don't I don't sorry I believe in an abortion ban after 18 through 26 weeks okay that's that's a more reasonable position I have to give you credit for that it's similar to Trump's 15 weeks yeah so why why do you think that most people don't share your view on that um well people just don't know really know what sentience is there's not a lot of conversation about abortion and these conversations are very difficult like they're conceptually hard to go through and I understand why a lot of people don't understand their positions on it I think people cutting off I thought thought we weren people I was actually complimenting [Music] I how are you nice to see you um so I just have one question there's like in any case you don't think there's any case where abortion should be legal there's a very very rare couple cases okay so you do think that a couple cases it is legal if if if cesarian section is not going to save the mother's life and the mother's life is actually at risk which is debated amongst growing numbers of OBGYNs okay that is the only case where abortion should be should be allowed but people say it is a growing consensus in the pro-life world that abortion is never medically necessary okay so if you had a daughter and she was 10 and she got raped and she was going to give birth and she no wait oh and she was going to give birth and she was going to live would you want her to go through that and carry her that's that's awfully graphic answer it's no but it's a real life scenario that happens to many people the answer is yes the baby would be delivered okay great so I that's insane um but let me tell you why no hold on let me ask you a question there's two ultrasounds I have one is a baby conceived in one is a baby conceived by a loving couple which one is which which which person here which person here was conceived by tell me which one was conceived by you don't know exactly cuz it's all human rights and it's all human beings matter it's but it's about your daughter who's passed to give birth to it and it's going to be tortured by that for the rest of her life that's going to take away every freedom she's ever going to have that's going to ruin her life she's going to grow up and going vitim crime the the point is how you were conceived is irrelevant to what human rights you get when hold on one second if a person conceiv the walks down the side of the street it's not like they don't get First Amendment rights or second amendment rights or the worst thing to do to that do the daughter is to then say hey we're going to go murder the being in inside of you they wouldn't even know like listen they they wouldn't know listen listen listen listen but wouldn't it wouldn't a better story to say something evil happened and we do something good in the face of evil instead of saying we're going to do evil and then murder the being because we're going to we're going to we're going to Pander to the evil no what makes what makes the West great is that we do good after evil not evil after evil it's not about the being and the the cells it's not about no no no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking no I'm speaking thank you so it's not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the person no I'm talking about the person who is dealing with the pregnancy I am not talking about the cells I don't I don't care listen the fetus the whatever I don't care about that right now until it is formed there is if there is a 5-year-old child who is pregnant and the baby is two weeks in can't get pregnant actually they have and they have given birthy old have given pregnant correct there is one recorded case of a 5-year-old birth is that is that is that common yes not it's common for 5-year-old get sometimes and it's they get pregnant I think they should be able to have medical access to something that could save not only just their life but like their Lively Hood how many how many I'm curious how many I hope your daughter lives a very happy life and gets away from you okay so that is really nasty and so her her belief system just so we're clear is that the time's up yeah no I got it it's fine I mean it's insanely nasty and we'll talk again my next claim is that college is a scam hello hello hello what's your name I'm Maddox how are you doing good so college is a scam well let's define our terms College being traditional for your college of course University not Community College or Technical College course a scam if we can agree on a definition is where a majority of people who will go through the institution or business uh they're not getting their money's worth their time's worth um and they're being deceived when they sign up so do we agree on those terms yeah perfect okay well what would further definitions what do you think is the purpose of going to college the purpose of college should be a traditional liberal arts education the pursuit of what is good true and beautiful okay that's not what it is uh it should be the betterment of yourself and your soul uh nurturing your character uh and becoming a better citizen understanding the deeper things in life at the very least though it should be preparing one for the job market do you think college does those things I think it does uh but I would add on to your point that I think not only is it for the betterment of your s but it's the for the betterment of society we need historians we need certain majors that may not make as much money I think those are for the betterment of society would you agree that there's some Majors that may not make money but are still essential to it depends do you think that getting a degree in gender studies is good for society uh I would agree yeah why why would studying gender not be good for study well learning that men can give birth is not exactly a good use of time is it is that what they're teaching in college right now colleges yeah according to the Center for Disease Control they no longer say women can give birth they say birthing person okay do you think men can give birth do I think men can give birth I think that uh yes or no question I think that a person who is assigned male at Birth I don't think they assign mail at Birth so people are not male at Birth I think that a person see you're evidence that college is a scam my friend college is a scam you're not you're lacking in a lot of here we can continue right now so gender studies do you think that studying gender is uh uh not Essential should we not deepen our first of all I don't think gender we're going to get there later I don't think gender exists I think that there are two Sexes infinite personalities and genders however let's get back to the core contention can I ask my question again real quick well I want to get back to my core contention a scam so the majority of kids that go to college if they end up getting a job at all they end up getting a job that does not require a college degree do you think that certain jobs that may not associate with a direct major can incorporate skills that you learn from a major I think I'm personally I'm an econ major and depending on what job I do in the future I can still use the skills earned from so tell me about Milton fredman tell me about Milton Freedman he is an economist from how about Thomas Soul Thomas Soul lud vanus lud well I will say that first how about I'd love to see you answer the gender studies question we will get there later that's that's what psychedelics are for uh who's [Music] next um well I think it's difficult to think about just one major thinking about just gender studies like sure like not everyone should be a gender Studies major we need doctors we need lawyers we need everything however why does it matter if 10 people want to be a gender Studies major and it matters to them like not everyone can be a lawyer not everyone can be a doctor there needs to be some people and you know what yeah it sucks that some people do go to college and get a degree and then they end up not in a Workforce for that but I don't think that has to do with like college was a scam it's more like maybe that just wasn't the path for them or that life choice was just too hard to get for them but some people are able to go to college and get a degree and use it and that is super important because imagine if no doctors went to college they just like I think I can do it well of course doctors and lawyers need credentialing right but well less than 5% of all people that go to college end up studying medicine or in legal the vast majority go into soft social sciences Communications with the humanities so you're in college or have been is that correct yeah are you forced to take classes that you think are a waste of time yeah I'm for you know what on so they're taking your money and they're forcing you that they're a waste of time that's kind of scammy right oh I think that some classes o some so you have to probably go in debt right depends okay are you going you going are you going into debt no okay well that's good I picked a school that actually offered me a scholarship someone else is paying for your college oh I I don't know depends on me I mean that school that wanted to give me an opportunity but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about talking about the scam element right so you said that there are some classes that if students had to go into debt or had to pay for would not be a good use of their time so it's not representing students well well do you think like high school is scam then cuz I had to pay for high school but I didn't I'm not going to use AP US History in my psychology degree ever well I think AP US History is actually a really good use of time knowing about your country and your history and well but I'm not going to use that in my career that's what we're talking about in the career path for college let's go back to what I said right we said traditional college right fouryear college and what a scam is we're a majority a majority of the people that will go through the Enterprise the business or the institution are not getting their time Worth or their money worth so therefore I go back to my core contention which is a majority of kids that exit College will not use their degree at all when they go to find a job but if you ask them do you think college was a scam I don't think majority of them are going to say yes some of them will some of them are going to well not everyone who's being scammed actively knows they're being scammed people still buy erectile dysfunction drugs off the internet and they get scammed that's their own personal choice of course people have choices to be scammed I'm not saying they don't have a choice I'm making an observation analysis of the institution for example flying Spirit Airlines kind of a scam should be shut down there is some yeah agree there are some things in life we have to take a step back and like oh the consumer is not being well served you want to shut down a bunch of majors in colleges that you think are scams no I never said that so what would your proposal be to fix the scam of college there is no proposal I'm simply the contention is college is a scam so then what's the point of that statement to get you to agree but like what would that do like what do you want to fix in college that's going to help in not be a scam let's we can get to step interval two as long as you can agree that college is a scam no cuz not for everyone for me I'm using a degree that's going to help me help people make better what are you studying psychology and criminal justice okay so and it's being paid for by somebody else which is which is fine that's good so psychology and criminal justice um do you do you absolutely need to get a degree to be able to get you do yeah I really I mean like I could I guess study it all on my own but it's just like makes more sense to go and have all these experience I'm getting like wonderful experiences internships all through my college that's helping no it's just that this is a paway that's really helping me so you know there's 11 million jobs open in the country right now that don't require a college degree okay then the people who want those jobs can go get those jobs I'm not one of those push too many kids into college no okay so the national graduation rate is 59% if I asked the room everyone would agree that they know some people that went to college that did not graduate yeah right so we're probably sending too many kids into this institution but if they might have been able to do it then like why is it not worth it to try and to push yourself to get a better education and go further that's a bad thing right but some people are able to work through that and it's like an opportunity thing when an institution is multi-trillion dollars in scale involves 23 million of our citizens every four years and is not actually better in the country for example if College was so great we would see incomes going up for Gen Z and Millennials we'd see more people able to own homes kids wouldn't I'm telling you this is so ableist what you're doing by the way I'm telling you right hello what's your name Al nice to meet you okay so let me start by saying well first of all you said we're sending too many kids to college who's sending them who's forcing them guidance counselors parents Community are they forcing them are they signing them up themselves forcing I never said forcing but you can have nudging and forcing are two different things we also subsidize College through the federal government so you guys get subsidized interest rates scholarships and Loans so the taxpayer is nudging students and gently and sometimes forcely pushing them into college and you would agree it is an expectation if you grow up in a upper middle class home to go to college you would agree with that so there's a societal cultural push I didn't grow up in an upper middle class so okay well but do you would you see it from their would you see how that's that argument is correct I guess there might be a pressure but no one's sending them you're sending yourself well of course well we're all over the age of 18 right when you're in college so you're sending yourself but that's besides let's be honest I mean for that's a silly argument yes they're technically send themselves I was just at Arizona State University moving everyone had their parents there they were co-signing on loans they were there helping pay for stuff parents the ones that are still checking in they're the ones that largely subsidize their lifestyle hey Mom can you vend me Veno me 3,000 bucks so that I can go out an extra night yes of course when you're 18 years old you're the one signing on the dotted line but there's enormous pressure and nudging and cultural expectation that students go to college right okay I think the problem here is that it's it's up to the person you're you're not you can't just go to college and expect to come out with a degree you have to put the work in you have to put the work in you have to make connections and some people might think college is just four years of partying and drinking and making friends whatever but you have to actually put the work in and if you put the work in you make connections then you can find a job right outside of college well no not not doubting that you can't find a job it's just that 52% of them get a job that doesn't require them to get the degree but most jobs offer intent to pay if you have a degree and 86% 86% of people with a degree get paid more then people with just a high school diploma that's only if you count the ones at the top 10% of in income iners so not if you count Humanities not if you count um people that study in the uh social sciences if you count medicine or you count law that's absolutely correct however the vast majority of kids that go to college are not studying medicine law engineering business finance they're studying Communications social scien or Humanities which are on the lower income ladder so as I mentioned we have 11 million job openings in this country right now that do not require a college degree I'm guessing in this room that within four to five years you guys would killed to be able to earn 80,000 $80 to $100,000 a year yes do you know that in States across the country and in cities they're offering apprenticeships become plumbers and welders electricians that doesn't require for your college degree entrance salary $80,000 a year but again 86% of people with a bachelor's degree earn more than people with a high school dipla no 86% of all people with a bachelor's degree if you take out the top 10% it's actually lower than those that don't go to college so the reason that number that average goes up is because the the doctors and the engineers and the lawyers are the ones that bring that average so significantly up but let me ask you a question that do you think that there's any waste at all in the current College model do I think there's any waste I don't think we need all of it okay good what part um well you have to start with your core classes and it's like high school you're taking the same classes in do you think like for example um do you think that it's okay nice to meet you [Music] wow I'm Emily nice to meet you Emily thank you um earlier said that about 5% of college students are going into fields of like medicine law and Engineering was it let let me clarify yes as far as they're going to be able to get postgraduate degrees so they will go all the way up and get their jurist master or they will end up passing the bar or becoming a doctor right so it's easy to say doctors lawyers but Health Care Professionals if you count nurses or people that work in healthcare that number is closer to 20 25% okay so 5% um who has a doctor can you like raise your hand if you have a doctor like a medical doctor a doctor yeah like a medical doctor yeah you do okay um 5% is still a lot of people right of course but that means 95% might not need to exist at the institution I don't think that's the takeaway just because 5% which is still millions of Americans all across board but if you were to say hey we only have medical schools only have legal we can get rid of gender studies get rid of so what's what's the contention well gender studies is actually if you look on like the pre-law track gender studies is a pre law track if you're going to be a lawyer you have to study gender studies and other social cult point that college is a scam why would why would a lawyer need to study gender studies should a lawyer know the law it's a social science the law you think the law isn't inadvertently affected by social cultural and gender Norms of course it is but shouldn't they first know the Bill of Rights the Constitution The Federalist Papers we learned that in high school okay so what is marber versus Madison I haven't been in high school for a really long time I'm not trying to be a lawyer Lear yeah so I mean high schools are brown what was Brown versus the Board of Education that's for desegregating school okay good yeah which project 2025 wants to like defund the Department of Education who wrote the Constitution founding fathers 1778 I don't know it wasn't 17 at 78 I don't know yeah you don't know no okay well this is the point is that you don't learn it in high school you don't even learn it in undergraduate and our our law school is not learning it so maybe well I'm not in law school no the point is that you were saying they already learned it and they don't I don't want this to be a pop quiz or trivia I didn't go to college and I'm asking you very basic Civic questions and you're paying to go to college and you can't answer them that's so fair but I think thank you [Music] sorry I have a question is church a scam no because church is honoring the Divine and the internal and the good and the true and the Beautiful is college but it but it deceives people because you you give a promise of everlasting life which you don't actually get because Christianity is contradictory logically speaking do you want to get into a theological debate or are we going to talk about college because I complet completely disagree Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior and we will have eternal life okay so how if there is a perfect being that created the world how could we exist in an imperfect world I'm happy to have this discussion can we go back to college though because do you think because that's a little bit of a red herring and a little bit of a rabbit hole tell me what that has to do with college being a scam well I do think college can be a scam for certain people I don't think it's a scam for everyone for people like me college was very beneficial for me for sure I'm asking you based upon your definition of a scam do you consider the Christian Church a scam of course not it's giving people life and treat teaches them goodness Christianity is false then that's a deception okay but you think it's false I don't we can agree to disagree also I'm not agreeing to disagree on that but we're not talking about we're not talking about the church we're talking about college right so again also people are not paying to go to church are they but it's a redu absurdum you know that is ask the question what's a redu out ofum uh that's a Latin term that means reducing down to the lowest common belief correct yeah so I'm taking am I right I didn't go to college I knew that I'm taking your particular position let let me ask you a question without you interrupting me do you pay to go to church uh no I don't some people forced to pay based upon their particular denomination in today do you pay to go to church depending on the church no no you don't do you have to go to debt and to go to church uh in some circumstances people do because they have to give up 10% of their income to be able to do that which people can't circumstance well they're LDS you understand that a lot of LDS Churches specifically require 10% they don't require it and you're talk do in plenty of places well you're asking Mainline Christian isn't their stigmatization if you don't do that okay you're good at interrupting not good at answering well you haven't answered any of my questions yet I did say no church is not a scam church is the bride of Christ college is a scam and college is people are going into debt they're paying a lot of money but I want to ask you a question you said it's a scam for some people who is it a scam for yeah for people who specifically aren't ever going to use it never use any of the knowledge that they from it well you say 52% I don't think you can grant qualify 52% of people don't do that for example for example my job that's not going to be recommended like as like an economics degree and most economics Majors AR going to go into Tik Tok debating online but I use the information that I learned in college in like on in my job on a daily basis so I still qualities that are then used in my job later on what percentage of kids that go to college are being scammed can you I don't think I don't think anyone knows that it's dependent upon an individual I have no clue shouldn't we try to find out well if you'd like to find some empirics on that I'd love to see it I I just did so 41 41 well well the Department of Education is a source no the Department of Education doesn't say 41% of people it was a scam for or that they didn't use any of the information they learned in college you are you are using so are you saying none of them use any of the information can I say three words without you interrupting me do any of them use the information L on can I say five words that interrupt you've interruped me multip time multiple times so since you say college is a scam for some people it's a ballpark for the kids that do not graduate 41% that ended up going and not graduating were they scammed uh no just because you go and pay for a particular thing but then you don't follow through with it doesn't mean you were scammed maybe they were you decided to pay for it oh you could say some people are misled some people are sing to these things some people are met in are misled in the church and you never answered my question on that because you're trying to I did take that time down so you don't have to answer the question about Christianity because you know your world if you looks terrible well what about Christianity you want me to answer we're talking I think it's false because I was saying is is church a scam if church is a scam that'd be predicated off of the idea that you're deceived into believing that there's everlasting life specifically from Christianity again so Christianity has to be true so can you grant that what's the argument Christianity is true did the resur what the argument you're going to let me finish three words in a row appreciate it okay did the resurrection happen uh I don't think the resurrection occurred okay I disagree okay so let me ask you a question a perfect Creator is it possible for them to not desire something imperfect a perfect is a perfect Creator I'm sorry what there's a perfect creator that desires everything that's just perfect how can they desire something imperfect flaud well because maybe they want to get to know themselves maybe they want to see their own creation maybe they love want get to know them can I can I finish can I finish talking here okay maybe because God loved the world so much that his creation which rebelled against him given agency and Free Will rebelled against them then got eternal life what we actually deserve and then sent his son on a rescue mission to save us from that the church is the bride of Christ will save us from Damnation that we deserve college is far from the Bride Of America it's currently scamming the Youth of this country and sending them into Oblivion didn't answer the question I I did no you didn't say how they could desire something imperfect how how well God can anything that later God can do anything so even something logically contradictory it's not logically contradictory so desire something imp an un can an Unstoppable can an Unstoppable object can an Unstoppable object hit aable Force hey before we go any further we want to take a moment to say thanks so much to straight arrow news for powering the fact checks in this video straight arrow news is

supporting a group of journalists that are raising the bar on news and focusing on serving you unbiased straight facts thanks again to straight arrow news for partnering with us on this episode now let's get into it yeah my next claim is that trans women are not [Music] women okay what's your name Sam nice to meet you uh let's define our term uh a woman is an adult female of XX chromosomes you tell me what is a woman I think a woman is somebody who identifies as a woman got it so that's not a definition that's like saying a table is something that identifies as a table give me an objective definition of no it's not a table is an object well tell tell a table can't identify as anything it doesn't haveo you have to give me an objective definition of what a woman is if I decided right now that I wanted to identify as a woman I would be a woman okay but that's not that doesn't answer the question I know but right now I'm a man right so if that happened right now woman once once a person makes the decision to identify as a woman woman that's a separate issue what is a woman that's the definition no I know but you have to tell me what a person who identifies thems as a woman but you have ident how do you know that they are that thing how do I I don't need to know what they I can ask them if I want to know but there needs to be you need to tell me what that thing is though somebody who we're not getting anywhere we're not getting any it's important because it's like saying a giraffe is a thing that looks like a giraffe or a coyot thing that looks like a coyote it's called circular reasoning you have to give me a actual definition I don't have to I I did give you a definition no you said that a woman is something that thinks they're a woman that doesn't give me a definition that simply what would you consider a definition then an adult female with XX no no I mean like what what makes that a definition hello hi Juliana jul um I don't necessarily think that you can define a woman just by her chromosomes women are so much more than that they come in a variety of shapes sizes colors and I don't necessarily think that you can count out somebody who's trans just because they don't have a certain set of chromosomes there are also people who are born I'm trying to I'm drawing a blank uh intersects so XX y or Y YX or just yeah or like x0 nothing so so natural mutations upon the binary essentially right yes so but but they don't have both sex organs that both that both operate right yeah but that also I don't think necessarily works right because if it's X there's a so you're either more male or more female right so you might have both a penis and vagina but there's never been a case of someone who can impregnate themselves okay I also don't necessarily think that uh works for this situation but um I also want to say that one of my best friends is trans and I would say that she's more of a woman than I am I think that women Define themselves by multiple things not just their sex organs if somebody asked me who I was as a woman I would not say I have a vagina totally fair no I think you said something smart so you said that person is more of a woman than you are therefore you're greatting off a definition of something accomplishes Womanhood what is that I think it's well that's the thing too and I I do think that gets a little complicated right because there are social norms for a gender but I do think we try to break that right for sure but you said that specific friend is more of a woman than you are why I think she's a better person than me I think she Liv women are better people she's a better woman than I am I'm not saying women are better people no but what what makes a woman a woman because you said she's more of a woman than you are so I want to know what that definition is right okay I'm going to let somebody else go thank you okay all right Parker what is a woman uh a woman is an adult human person that has a desire to be in accordance with a particular set of Social and cultural norms that are typically associated with a female sex Define a man associate you're looking at one XY chromosomes and okay do does God the father have XY chromosomes Incarnation we literally have a religious a father and he's he him but he's not a man we have a religious so a man is someone with XY chromosomes but he doesn't have XY chromosomes he's still a man he still use prefer actually very interesting in the original Hebrew Adonai do you know what Adon is it's the Hebrew word for God it's actually genderless but in this in actually in the scriptures they use he right and they use the masculine Jesus Christ came to Earth as a man not as a woman not as gender queer but let's go back to but God the father is a man right All fathers are men well first of all there's a trinity so God the father is neither man nor woman he is omnicient omnipotent he is all being on top of so why do you use he well I did not the scriptures do you could use woman you could say her you could use him but the way that the language is structured again it is so the God the father is so above gender it is so above any of our understanding with glory and understanding again because you have to make a choice either he or him him or her in the Original Scriptures let's go back to I'm Happ father AR so I'm I'm so some fathers are not men and boys not men or boys I'm sorry some fathers are not male no of course they are I'm not wait so God the father is a male hold on God the father so where where do we get God the father from what what Greek word from your scripture well from ABA right which is a very close personal ter you're not answering my questions and you bring up random language that doesn't matter well it actually does no it doesn't but let me let me get down to the root of it because I CU he's not a man you know he's not a man under your worldview yet you still use his preferred pron you still call him a man you don't do that with trans people because you're transphobic that's why okay got it but Christ is a man I'm happy to get into the sexuality and gation not of the Trinity okay before Incarnation there's no penis there's no XY chromisms there's no small G second let's think about it if that's correct how is it then Jacob saw the face of God okay so if there's hold on if there was not before the Incarnation how did Jacob see the face of God how did Jacob wrestle with God characters can have faces without biology how did Jacob wrestle with God so so okay do you think that he has a body well or was that a figurative notion of of wrestle that's that's a mystery of the scriptures I'm not here well it is I'm not here to debate theology can we go back to we talking about he does he actual biology you keep trying to Pivot because you know this debunks you what what biology does your God have what what well the one of Christ Our Lord the I meant before Incarnation well I I to be honest I don't quite know and I don't think the scriptures are you don't know what a man is well you can't Define what a man is it's a little opaque again you're looking at a man but your your video the largest video on Tik Tok is what is a woman 20 million views but you don't know what a man is on your own world VI I said you're looking at a man right wait but God the father doesn't meet that criteria am I looking at a man okay good just make a man that's de beating you in that's fine so let me ask you a question though so do you think that anybody can become a woman um I think that anyone who meets my criteria is a woman what's your criteria again adult human person that has a desire to be in accordance with a particular set of Social and cultural norms that are typically associated with the female sex can Society ever be wrong sure but like it's it's it's a it's a desire to be in accordance with a set of Social and cultural norms can I become if I black face no because it's not a desire that you have to be in accordance with particular because race is defined phenotypically based upon the expression to other people but you're by some standard you're judging that do you think there's a phenotypical expression of someone who's white and someone who's black like I see you're white because you're phenotypical expression right so but do you think but Rachel doelle that said she is black and culturally black is she black does she does she have phenotypically uh characteristics we would associate phenotypical I'm not sure what that word means photp it's going to be the like the the expression yes okay so she she she could pass as a black person wait so she doesn't have the melanin content she's borderline no okay so then she's not black okay so you're able to say who is black and not black that's how we Define it in society no okay got it so but is there an objective definition of who is Black wait language is all subjective Linguistics professionals indicate it's subjective language is all subjective yes absolutely every word you just used was created by other human beings that are engaging in conversation you might think it's created by God but even then it's still subjective now wewh God subject now we're getting similar is the word and the value behind murder objective or subjective well I think morality is subjective but you think it's subjective too because it comes from God that's interesting wait does it come from God or independent of God well no it's of course it comes from God it's Transcendent being that's subjective yes it is if it comes from God it's it's specifically subjective it comes independent of God then it's objective what you just told me is is also comp moral antirealism so let's go back to the Ten Commandments you don't understand meta ethics well I I hold on a second what does subjective morality mean what does subjective morality means that it it comes in everybody's own opinion their own form not dependent on a stance God is a stance and that's the truth of morality so if let's let's let's believe do you believe in the if everybody believed in the concept of God the Transcendent God that there was a Ten Commandments and we should live by them right is that objective morality no just because people agree do make it objective again independent of stance AG is what is objective morality that sorry thanks we we'll be back at it next time Mason get are you nice to meet you okay so I think it's a little scummy that you're plagiarizing the whole Matt Walsh thing like your thing is the worship of Israel like that I pay him royalties okay for sure well do you want to talk about sex first or do you want to talk about gender I don't think gender exists I think it's a it's a it's a term that John money and Judith Butler created over the last 40 years that basically is a filler for personalities okay well if we're talking about sex which it seems like you're saying is the exact same thing um would you say sex is binary by definition for sure yes absolutely okay so you're already in correct like sex is not binary it's bodal so if you look at a distribution graph we're going to see people in two camps majority of the time but there are going to be externalities on both ends of the spectrum and in the middle we talk about inter however with intersects though they are mutations of a binary correct no we're we're talking about on but which we're talking about an entire Spectrum which which by definition defeating your expression of what a binary is by saying that there are externalities but but let me ask you a question that like xxy you're trying to create this own box and then use any examples that are outside of that box you brought up justify that box again you brought up interex we're talking about reality you brought up intersex what sex organs which one is more dominant what do you mean in an xxy situation can you explain your your point of view obviously you have more female characteristics than male characteristics in an xxy or it might be y YX one of the one of the two the point is that you do you do not have both we could see people with female reproductive organs that have XY and we can see the vice versa people with male reproductive organs that have ex sex so I think you said something about gender though I think that's more inter to get into do you understand how the convers we moving off of sex CU you're seing that argument no I'm not seing it you want to keep going into it we can if You' like okay so so besides male and female what categories exist we we have people that are interex we have people that are on the other ends of the bodal distribution gra are you are you aware what bodal means versus binary um somewhat of an understanding okay well you can be presented with a graph after this by the people that you brought with you but it's it's actually B distribution just like constantly going to condescending type talk is not going to be fruit I'm just trying to match your energy with the people that you treated that were trying to have a trans women are not women do you agree with that uh I would say that trans women are women because people that exist under the category of women people that exist under the category of men are still humans so that category how how is that defined well I wouldn't limit it to things like genitals or things like chromosomes which seems like you want to do um what type of genitals would you say I have since there OB genitals I'm not obsess genitals but I could do a blood sampling right now and I could see exactly what you are because every single one of your trillions of cells are either coded with XX or XY no no how much surgery or whatever I think that you are man but you could fool me you could take hormones you could play camouflage like I could fool you to be Hispanic if I had the right Hollywood makeup director that doesn't mean that you are the thing though but but you're going from an objective biological perspective which we've already talked about with sex I'm talking about a social construct or a social utility so like if we were at a restaurant right I'm sitting down and I'm sitting down at the table and you're telling the waiter hey I want to go sit with blank what would you use with you he doesn't know my name yeah I'm sitting over there that guy yeah yes correct guy you're going to typically use he or him or you're going to say that guy like you just said correct because you're ascribing the male gender to me based on my I say I could be an error maybe you are a biological woman and then you'd correct yourself right that take may maybe maybe not so that's what we that is exactly what we're trying to say we're so the question is that do you think that Womanhood can then be assumed just through costume design it's not costume design what is it then it's performative social characteris so you could act that's what gender is great it so you could it's like a theater troop it's not a theater troop these are social these are social can be appropriated no they're C they're categories that's what it is so so there's nothing inherent about the chromosomes there's nothing that correct wow we disagree so there's nothing inherent about having a period or being able to give birth or the specific hormonal makeup in different cultures we've ascribed that to Womanhood if you go back to other cultures spending thousands of years you'll see a difference when it like for example the Mayans had plenty of people that were schizophrenic right so that means nothing to me right okay we have people that say they're hearing things from God would you say that schizophrenic well not necessarily it built western civilization and common law and due process and individual rights defense of The Unborn and the greatest civilization ever you know that voice from God happened to build the greatest nation ever to exist in the history of the world that's fine okay I think the minds would say the same thing that's the problem with presuppositional arguments is that you could say mean God's telling me right now do you think that's real can we go visit the M Nation they didn't last that long did they yeah overkilling and violence and you can justify that if you like you mean all the child sacrifice this is the kind of that why I'm trying to match it is because you mean all the child sacrifice the mines and incin dead on the top of temples great civilization you want to go back in the Old Testament let's bring Parker up in here talk about all the the child child marriage we can talk about the justification of R where was child sacrifice ever in the Bible um when Isaac or Isaac was almost sacrificed by his dad he wasn't though because at the beginning of Genesis so God just said like no just kidding dog don't actually why because at the beginning of Genesis 16 said I'm going to test to Pro obedience yeah that's right so now you know it so actually no there was no child sacrifice in the Bible it was a Prohibition on child sacrifice the but anyway that's a little bit of a rabbit hole do you understand at least can you sympathize with our perspective okay that that I'll calm it down a little bit I apologize for the con I mean you're doing it's it's fine but you see where this could get wildly out of control at least on the I don't see how it get out of control because even in sports for example you think that there's no there's so this is this is something that we might be able to agree upon right Sports were not archaeologically dug up right the rules of sports they are things that we've created as a society we have decided as a society the most Fair categorization is male Sports and female sports now as we've been able to understand or at least bring into the Forefront people who don't identify with the bind we still have to allow all people that are women in the women's category and all men that are men in the women's category that includes CIS and trans if you'd like to change that category because you think it's unfair we can do that that's what's awesome about arbitrary rules is we can decide hormones I might not know this but like when the Greeks started the Olympics 2,000 years ago did they have like a bunch of dudes wrestling with women I don't even think they allowed women to compete well I might be wrong on that but that kind of proves the point though that there was a what did we do to allow women we changed the rules right no but that by definition therefore there is something from body composition bone mass long density testosterone and estrogen rates so Endocrinology is different if you if you'd say the majority of males in the botal distribution graph we're going back to that you can say hey we we want this level of hormones in this particular category and we can separate it by hormones I agree with you that a majority of men are majority of sity you got to be like 99.9% I don't know Ronda Rousey could kick my ass I will say that no for sure but I mean but could she kick Conor McGregor's ass well now we're talking about the Peaks right she said theend no because you're talking about the peaks of two different categories in the same sort of right because because why she's a CIS woman well she's a CIS woman and a CIS man but yes and he could kick her tail right yes I would agree okay for sure right because CIS men and CIS women have different hormone levels if you want to change the hormones we can change the categorization you're saying that you want men and women Bar None and you say that's the most like Fair category then we have to all men but again there those things don't so I just want to be clear so because I think I'm tracking your argument is that in the University of Pennsylvania swim team when Thomas swam against biological women that was you're perfectly fine with that I think as long as we have the categories that way thanks good to meet you yeah you want to get him in this isn't debated yet no no no you're fine you're fine you're fine what's your name hi my name is pry nice to meet youney nice to meet you go ahead pry pry t r you're totally yeah um okay so I kind of want to go back to a little earlier you said that a Parker has lower T than you so would you say a joke yeah no no I'm I'm fully I'm fully aware of a joke but I guess like on that on that point do you think that like tea has to do or testosterone has to do with your manhood like well yes and no I mean for if you are looking at typical testosterone estone rates of women they are far different than those of men but for example like your testosterone rate goes down when you have children for example when you're a man that doesn't make you less of a man they go they go down by by 400 points okay but like when we were talking earlier about like sports right and you were saying that the reason why it's unfair for like like for example a trans woman who used to be a man to be like competing in women's sports you said you cited that they have higher testosterone levels one of about 50 characteristics also lung density the men's hearts are bigger we have greater bone B bone bone density muscle mass okay be faster T to be stronger I I understand but like those factors all come from the hormones during the development process say correct no not necessarily no I mean most of them do well not all of them so for example you could try to pump a young girl's body with testosterone at 8 years old and you can get them stronger you cannot necessarily get them on par with a biological male at puberty you cannot you could try okay but like because there's something in the coding of our genetics the coding of our genetics which is often like controlled by like different like I guess parts of our DNA and also the hormones that are produced that affect the the effective coding ology it's a big part because for example if you just give a kid testosterone that doesn't even get them close to becoming a male or estrogen giving them a female they might get characteristics that are close to that right okay but it does for but I mean like there's no perfect image of like this is what a female looks like this is what a male looks like like we all get our periods at different ages some of us like like and also like for example like there are many circumstances where Womanhood is just not one thing right it's a multitude of experiences every single person can you define what Womanhood is that's an interesting question for you well no I can't Define what Womanhood is and the reason why is because it's something that's an individual experience for every single person right like my experiences what I have experienced throughout my life is not going to be the same as another woman who may have like grown up in a different environment disagreement but not Clarity I say that being a woman or Womanhood is an objective thing right but objective outside of one own's opinions or experien so but are we at the point where we're discussing where this is like not something based on your chromosones but something maybe based on a construct well no it also can be objectively witnessed in empirical ways in biological ways in scientific ways okay so to clarify we're still discussing whether Womanhood is on chromosomes or not if if you'd like to discuss that it's deeper than just chromosones right right I'm just trying to for ex for example if we look at spec scans or brain scans of men and women 98% of the time artificial intelligence can tell you which one is the men and which one is the male female okay so our different parts of our brains fire so for for men for men for example are amygdalas are not as highw working as women you know what amydala is the threat assessment part of your so obviously like your birth so there's a difference between the concept or what sex is which is a biological aspect and what gender is which is a social construct I reject gender completely as a different word it's really personal that's where the debate is it's the existence of gender gender gender means personality okay I don't doubt that biological men might havein how would you define race on that point how would I Define how you def race well race is a very difficult topic top okay because I think that it's a really important thing to discuss when it comes if I draw if I draw blood is it ethnic lines is it if you have a blood sample of a black individual and a white individual I can't tell you which one is which if I have a blood sample of a man and a woman I can tell you which one is which just by running very simple Elementary blood tests so for example if there was a Hispanic or a white there is no difference in the genetic coding there just isn't why is it important that someone's oh okay my next claim is that kamla Harris is a Dei [Music] candidate a lot of competition Mason yeah exactly good to see you good to see you again um can I define what a Dei candidate is I I think that you're GNA say because she's black and she's a woman she's appointed because Joe Biden promised that and it's is not a testament to her not only that but also in the her getting the nomination of the Democrat Party they said repeatedly we do not want to pass over a black female okay so just those two things but the first one is stronger you're right Joe Biden said I'm going to put on my vice presidency a black female right right so his criteria yeah and that was like Karen bass and KLA Harris so she was not chosen because of her intellect or her accomplishments or because of any of that it was because she happened to fit a couple boxes in fact Amy kachar the vetting at the time was that Amy kobar would have been a better VP and kamla ended up getting it so it's just a statement of fact that she is there not because of her Brilliance or accomplishments but because of her ethnicity so KLA Harris first and foremost there are a lot of criticism that you can give to her on why she wouldn't be an effective president it shouldn't be because she's a woman or because she's black and it seems to be that you're I'm just I just want people to understand and agree she didn't earn this she she absolutely did she has she has a career where she's been not only a de de stands one earn it just so we're clear but like it stands for diversity Equity inclusion I like the meme though I I know what it is but do you at least admit and acknowledge that when Joe Biden was searching for a VP he cared more about skin color and a female than the smartest best person so the the whole conversation with this affirmative action with Dei the whole reason why people bring it in is to make this imaginary scenario that there's a super qualified white man who was overpassed by this unqualified stupid idiot person of color which is such a terrible analogy because it's not true absolutely not true that's not what it is Jo bid did not say I'm going to choose an unqualified person just his own team he's saying that I'm going to have two qualified people if one comes from a different experience it might be better to have a diversity and have a better perception in forms of he said at the South Carolina debate that will pick a black woman as my vice president secondly Amy kachar came out is this a random black woman that he plucked off the street or is this a qualified DEA general attorney who's had a decorated career leading government positions you can but you keep rambling about things that just aren't relevant to what we're talking it is relevant AB kachar in vetting came across as the more qualified candidate why because they said kamla Harris wasn't very smart wasn't very bright that's their own vetting documents from the from who Joe Biden's own vetting documents show why would he go against that because the base of the Democrat Party demands tribal politics and Dei politics over competency that's completely inur he stated to Jim kber said I will only endorse you in the South Carolina primary if you say that you're going to put a black person preferably a black female on your ticket with you therefore you winnow the entire universe down and say I'm only going to choose from this criteria and let's just think more broadly if you're about to have heart surgery would you rather have a heart surgeon that's good and excellent knows what he's doing or someone that is a black female so and being president is more important than being a heart surgeon aren't you on record saying that you'd be terrified if there was a black pilot that was was flying I did say that but what why what was the full quote I I personally I don't know if you want to expand on yeah so this this ties into this United Airlines said that half of all their new hes are going to be black or women and that standards and pursuit of Excellence is not going to be taken as um seriously as diversity when I'm flying a plane I want to know my pilot is there because they're a good pilot not because they fit some Dei box damn it I wish we could have a better conversation I'm sorry man fast man okay so let's say that KLA Harris was the Dei hire as vice president do you think she's also a deer as the Presidential nominee for the Democratic party potentially yeah I mean they decided to go to her almost immediately because she is the VP but also because she fits some criteria boxes but let me ask you you you don't think it's because Joe Biden nominated or no for sure that's part of it of course it is but let me ask you what's her greatest achievement accomplishment her greatest achievement accomplishment I'd say her greatest achievement or accomplishment is completely destroying their Republican party within like 2 weeks of being nominated like in the polls she's just absolutely huh sorry how are you nice to see you what's your name Amanda Amanda so you believe because kamla is black and a woman she was chosen for belief her own team Joe Biden said that he said I said that yeah he said I'm first because beforehand he said I'm going to choose a black female for vice president president he didn't say I'm going to choose the most gifted or the most talented or the most accomplished he said so he said I'm going to choose a black female and so by definition that is Dei that is not the definition of Dei by him saying that he was going to choose a black female that could insinuate that he already had comma mind for the role no way does that insinuate that she's Dei what is Dei then Dei would be choosing somebody based on their race no it's giving people of color the opportunity to be welcomed into spaces in which they typically AR able to get there's never been a female black vice president and why do you think that is well not why you just said that's Dei so by definition she's Dei okay so she represents diversity within the government no I'm saying she got elevated because she was a black female because if that were the case I'd be the president right now do do you do you think do you think kamla Harris was chosen because of her intelligence her qualifications and her intelligence really wow if you compare what's greatest accom what's her greatest accomplish prosecutor within the Northern California area you mean letting out violent criminals and turning San Francisco one of the most murderous dangerous arson fied homeless field slums in the country that's her greatest accomplishment see I actually went to UC Berkeley so I lived there I don't know if you did uh I went around Berkeley is a slum Berkeley is a slum have you stepped into Berkeley yes I have you think Oakland and Berkeley have you lived in Berkeley I've lived in Oakland as well your basing your you think the Bay Area is like a good area in this country I'm from Vegas so I'm not from the bay born raised in Vegas and went to UC Berkeley CH graduated this year what you're saying literally in no way shape formar so you think her overseeing San Francisco becoming the laughing stock of the country is fris is not the laughing stock of the country if anything that'ss Florida no offense but hold on if that's the case why are millions of people moving to Florida and millions of people leaving California because there are cheaper rates there people are moving to Las Vegas Las Vegas it's cheaper because it's a better run State and we don't give money to is Northern California is not the entirety of California there's Southern California Cali why is it that so many businesses are leaving San Francisco if she did such a great job lowering crime do you know businesses go where things are cheapest to operate why are they cheaper because they're better run states do you realize that California is one of the most populated states within the US so obviously cost are going to be high not only that but land within this state is also very very very minimal so hold on you have you have tons of land you're one of the biggest states in country yes it is one of the biggest lands but do you also take into account the population that's here yes Florida and Texas have a greater combined population than California and Cal California has more population and more more land mass than Florida why is it that San Francisco has a declining population and Miami Tampa Orlando have an increasing population what does this have to do with Dei because she ran San Francisco poorly and she was chosen as a VP because she was a black woman San Francisco she was the da da of San Francisco she's Prosecuting and then she became the AG of California where crime went up homelessness went up arson went up kidnapping went up is it not the job of the police to get the criminal the attorney the attorney general of the state is the top cop of the state yes and what did she do to lower crime in California she convicted those who were guilty why did crime go up because as the population increases and this econ e economy gets worse no wor people are becoming more and more desperate which leads to C of crime thank [Applause] you mine will be quick mine will be really quick goad okay so real quick you're saying that the only reason she was elected was is because she's black so that trumps her being a district attorney and all the this is not my words I'm just going on Joe Biden's own words Joe Biden said I'm going to preset criteria based based on black women and therefore she met that met that criteria and that's why she was selected no why I think he was what he was trying to say is oh I'm she's just black she was just calling her black she's not saying I'm doing he's not saying he's not saying I'm doing this because she's black that's not what she said he made a public promise before the selection even began and the process began I will put a black woman on the ticket so you're saying her being dist attorney doesn't matter that's not why but an aw being a failed businessman and making all the comments weird comments he's made well hold on a second that doesn't have like what I'm getting at though is that if she was not a black woman she never would have been chosen as vice president her record was abysmal she was a terrible Attorney General of California she had poorly I'm so sorry I'll be quior I'll be quick I'm so sorry she she gets the next one yeah all right sorry yeah I just have to know do you think Tim Waltz is a Dei candidate okay I just wanted to see consist Dei does not mean black timal was only chosen because the Democrat Party is doing so poorly with white men that they tried to find a white man that they could put on the ticket but then also true Tim Walls is the first White Dei candidate in history okay in the Democratic primaries KLA harros was performing incredibly well and she wasn't performing well in the primaries just because she was black she was performing well in the primaries because during her time as a senator she spoke incredibly eloquently I used to watch hold on a second how did she do in the Democrat primaries she did like much better than Amy kachar she didn't even make it to Iowa she dropped out months ahead of the first primary she was super unpopular not well-liked her campaign fizzled out so she was she was popular initially initially yes and then the more people learned about her the more realized she was awful well it was mostly because like progressives are really upset about her being a DA which like can be like that that's a completely different why aren't progressives upset about that now I mean they are but oh they are that's new to me everyone's talking about how great prosecut she is progressives are definitely upset about the like how um like the Biden Administration has handled like the atrocities and gods and how like they they are definitely things that Democrats are upset about however that's not the point of this conversation i that's correct that is not Point that's not the point what the point is is that a lot of a thanks guys okay hi how are you doing right so um you keep saying that K Harris is a dii candidate and I feel my main fallacy with this argument is that competency can't be objectively determined because we all have subjective definitions of what a competent politician is but my question for you is if kamla Harris is a Dei candidate why is she beating Trump in the polls right now we'll see what happens in November okay but she's currently beating Trump in the polls so either if the polls are right I grant you that she's incompetent or or maybe she's a new candidate with a big surge I I I would caution you being a little like this point in the election getting too cocky because we remember what happened with I'm not getting cocky I'm asking you to answer a question if she is incompetent how could she beat the president who you said is an as of the timing of this filming can you name to me how many times she sat down for an interview what no she refuses to talk to the Press refuses to take questions she's not one sit down interview in nearly 25 days at the filming of this interview mind you which I don't know a very weird point to make why would I count how many times kamla Harris has interview because she refuses to take questions from the press and media like shouldn't you do that if you're the city vice president she's uh he actually did three last Sunday and one today with Meet the Press so the quality the qualification of a good president is to take an interview if you can't take a single question but let me ask you this because it's on you can what's her greatest accomplishment as vice president as vice president being the first female all black president we've never had no no like I got that but like what what's her accomplishment that made people's lives better I don't know vice presidents don't really do much to be honest can you name one thing she's done that's good no probably not thank you the inflation reduction act really did that lower inflation what's your name Brad Brad Brady nice to meet you uh I like the idea 30 seconds on 30 seconds off I think the best thing I could say about this is you have your opinion and I can have mine you believe that Donald Trump was a good president I maybe don't believe that you believe that KLA Harris is a Dei candidate for the position of President I don't believe that what I'm getting to is what do you gain from this if I concede and say that KLA Harris is a Dei candidate what do you gain because I know what it is you're baiting us into rage so that you can make money on your Tik Tok account you're baiting college students all over the world and to arguing with you over these fallacies you throw a red herring out there and you're making money from this account well we're sitting here and looking stupid first of all I don't control this account I'm guest here this is Jubilee media and they're going to edit it how they see fit okay number one number two it needs to be acknowledged that she didn't earn it she didn't win a Democrat primary she dropped out in the Democrat Primary in 2020 she's never been likable she's got there simply because of race not because of Competency not because she's good at her job and I think that's wrong and it needs to be called out you're bringing up qualitative examples these are all subjective qualitative examples her race her competency her dropping out of the election these that's not what you said earlier this is I'm talking about the points you've just bought up multiple qualitative points and these points can be believed by you and not by me as you believe in a God and I don't these are qualitative arguments that you're making against me for this and I can believe differently than you and I think we can agree to disagree on this one okay fine perfect okay I think this is going to take the entire time you're welcome 30 on 30 off how do you feel about the Senate uh far as her her tiebreaking vote of the Senate no no no I'm just saying like Senate like like the Senate is technically Dei in a certain sense for like small states like Wyoming gets people W Wyoming get a greater vot than in California like Rhode island in Hawaii I'm giving you an example California I get less of a vote than someone who exists in Wyoming so we're giving people in Wyoming more say than they necessarily should given that they're one individual so why do you believe in Dei as it relates to how our government is set up we don't believe in Dei in terms of allowing for people who are black or who are women to be in positions of power that they have not been allowed in historically speaking so um is the electoral college and the Senate based on race it's it's predicated off of diversity equity and inclusion right like inclusion of of of country areas inclusion of rural areas inclusion of white men like you okay so you mean like Hawaii I'm referencing I'm referencing you could say smaller States or places that have less people in it obviously would be able to have more of a say per individual so your argument is that US Senate is a Dei I I can be honest I've never heard that argument but I think it's a little silly but how is it silly argue against it instead of just saying it's silly well right so it's silly on its face because first of all we have on the House Representatives is proportional to population but but the Senate isn't so it's de it's not Dei yes it is what why would you say it's diversity Equity inclusions because Wyoming gets two senators they're their own sovereign state aren they for Country areas for rural areas equity for rural areas for smaller States so let's go back to the Federal papers and the founding fathers why was the Senate compos tell me why it's not de like under your definition why not based on race and by way it does have to be based it's not based on equity and it's not based on inclusion can you have based upon different character other than race whether or not you're a woman whether or not let let me finish why it's because we are a collection of States we are not a federal project so states rights usurp federals do you know what the 17th amendment is do you know do you know the why the Articles of Confederation failed yes but what is the 10th Amendment because had to right had too much power that's why we specifically aded the let me let me make one point okay which is how did we us to elect Senators it' be population no we used to elect Senators based on state legislatures so the Senate is an extension of the state legislative bodies that's not Dei that's federalism that's the way that our system is set up which is a bottom up citizen-led government to allow the states which are first and foremost Sovereign so it goes in this lad in this country that's still de for those States for those country areas no because it's blind it's not that oh is not only based on race hold on a second diversity for for Country diversity for World equity for World an inclusion of that's an inter point is only because associate with Harris let me ask you a question is there a single instance in Corporate America or Dei is implemented where diversity means anything other than skin color diversity so diversity view women women what fine how about chromosone or diversity or skin color so so so skin color there's gender you had to you have to move the goal poost a little bit because you got destroyed there all right but there's also no I'm just asking a very simple question the answer is no because our system of do mean that's not DEET your Senate is Dei what was your definition though what what is what was your definition diversity Equity inclusion diversity doesn't only apply to race you're just saying other people definity Equity inclusion to be based on race you didn't though let me finish because you're saying it didn't earn it you know who did earn it South Dakota and North Dakota when they charted themselves into States Wyoming didn't earn it because they have less into a state hold on all right who really wants to go I I don't want to pick on I don't want to pick on somebody who doesn't want to get picked on okay um you want to debate wa what is the top whatever you want so you're you're the affirmative I'm the negative yeah let's do it you're good with 10 minutes I don't want to put you in a spot you don't want to be in no no no let's do it let's fun you sure [Applause] okay okay I guess the claim I'm making is that affirmative action is constitutional tell me about your plan I wanted to talk about affirmative action because we haven't really gotten to it and it's recently been revoked based on the new Supreme Court ruling um and I firmly believe that affirmative action is constitutional and is a right that certain American citizens deserve and I just wanted to your thoughts on that um well the 14th amendment allows for equal protection regardless of race and it's a colorblind Amendment and the whole idea of affirmative action is to try to give people extra um boost based on their skin color or their racial background which by definition Cuts underneath the idea of equal protection okay um so do you know why the 14th amendment was founded and the equal protection and Equal Rights Act yeah the 14th amendment was a post Civil War amendment 145 167 we all during Reconstruction so what was it in response to slavery oh and who were slaves well that's that's an important point so the do you think affirmative action will help heal the multigenerational problems of slavery I do I really do because um so let's just talk about the history for a second slavery begins in the early 1800s earlier no slavery 1816 is the beginning of slavy 1619 oh yeah I guess it would be okay first slaves come in 16 19 doesn't end until 1800s 1880s then we go into Jim Crow laws starting in 1877 and black people are not given equal rights until officially 1965 would you agree with that that's generally the the correct telling yeah so you know 1960s 197 just so we're clear that black Americans able to serve in office in the early 1900s they were able to vote throughout the 1900s but yes there were pole taxes there was Jim Crow laws there was was segregation of course there was and we have to be yeah delal not to acknowledge those things okay so we can acknowledge all of those things can we also acknowledge due to the laws under Jim Crow that black people were significantly hindered from economic advancement this is a really important question the data shows not really it was evil it was terrible but black Americans are poor today in 2024 than they were in the 1950s yes why do you think that is good question so we have the Civil Rights Act we have more benefits more government programs something changed between the 1950s and 2024 so there's two answers to this question either America got more racist since 1950s 2024 so like that 70-year period because blacks America black Americans are worse off today per capita they you agree with that okay good yeah than in the 1950s or there's another explanation and I think the truth is somewhere in the middle which is I think you would acknowledge that the The Disappearance of the black father has been the number one driver of black poverty in this country now there are reasons for that yeah what do you think the reasons for that are well culture is one would you agree so actually let's go back to the foundation prison pipeline all that stuff but do at least can we at least agree that black dad's not being around is a bad thing anyone's father not being around is a bad thing of course but 75% of black youth are not raised with a father in the home it's the highest of any group in the country it used to be 25% in the 1950s so it's gone up dramatically in 70 years okay so you are blaming the fact that black people have not be able been able to achieve economic equality and advancement in this country decre specifically and solely because of the ABS not solely it is the most primary ingredient reason most so you think it's the absence of black fathers correct and you think what else public sector teer unions that have kept these schools crummy and kids aren't reading and teachers keep getting paid we don't fire Bad Teachers that's a big thing okay war on police in our inner cities and not having enough police and not actually put locking up criminals let me hear me out for example in Chicago do you know that only half of all murders go go solved in the city of Chicago that doesn't surprise me at all that's a problem right that is a problem yeah so we need more police more detectives to solve those murders but I I want to hear your points to I'm talking too much so let's go back a little bit to what you said in the issue of policing now starting in the 1980s and continuing onward there's been a War on Drugs is this correct I like I like the War on Drugs you like the War on Drugs so during the War on Drugs it created an epidemic of mass incarceration specifically if you're using drugs no or pedaling drugs if you don't use drugs then you don't go to jail right so you believe that the criminal justice system is Flawless no I've never said Flawless there's a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be in jail there's a lot of problems in any system okay so wait let's CL on that so you believe that a lot of people who have gone to jail shouldn't be in jail a small percent what percent would you say 5% you would say only 5% correct when you have a system of justice you're going to have scummy prosecutors you're going to have bad defense attorneys I have a question can I get a Google what percentage of people currently incarcerated are black it's way larger than well it's hold on it's what it's way larger than no I know but the fact the fact I'm saying the fact I'm saying 5% so that's the point that I'm trying to make exactly who am I Deb am I debating here am I if your own government is pumping drugs yeah so wait okay so I want to make a quick you're right black Americans are in prison far greater than the percentage of the population so the black Americans about 13 to 14% of the population about half prisoners are black so blacks commit more crimes than whites do they commit more murders they commit more arson they commit more kidnappings for example blacks are 133% of the population and they commit 58% of all the murders that's not a War on Drugs That's a culture problem okay so let's talk about that culture black people have been legislatively subjugated up until 1965 I'll give it I mean honestly it's later but let's just say 1965 you do not think that that 10 generations of legislative subjugation and slavery during that time 4,000 black men women and children are lynched as the result of race riots in this country you do not think that these things have a lasting effect we have had 10 generations of subjugation and four of legislative course they have an impact but it's more on you to explain why things got worse since the Civil Rights Act more violent less fathers around poorer why is that because of mass incarceration and the unfair criminalization of black men but let's just take murders for example why are why blacks are 13% of the population and commit 58% of the murders why is that because people in affluent and whiter neighborhoods are not being policed at the same are more I'm talking about dead bodies there's no like we're not talking about police saying we're talking about murders why are so many blacks committing murders outside of their population okay let's take it back to some history I'm curious for an answer to that question going to give you one so let's go to redlining okay red lining red lining yes is why so many blacks are killing each other no let me finish my claim and then you can respond is that okay okay so red lining federally mandated or sustained by the FHA right separating black Americans to specifically impoverished and relegated areas of the country we are incapable of buying homes and putting Equity into neighborhoods with lower crime rates and better Educational Systems we do not have access to things that would uplift and help our community when you are put in an environment that promotes and reinforces social and economic inequality you become desperate and are forced to do things that maybe don't align with your values what you're making you're making an excuse for a lot of murder when you have steal a high concentration of a subjugated people in one area if you were right when blacks in America did not have the same rights they had today there were less they were less murderous there was less Breakin why is that so I'm sorry are you trying to say that blacks Thrive under subjugation no I'm not I'm saying they I'm asking you the question the data shows they were actually better in the 1940s it was bad it was evil but what happened something changed they committed less crimes maybe they afraid I mean 4,000 black men women and children were killed in violent Lynch Mark that's your explanation but I racial Terror permeated American culture for hundreds of years Black America is worse than it has been years the generational psych of an entire group of people I'm sure it did I'm not discounting that I'm just trying to understand why is it the more social welfare we've done so we've spent 20 trillion dollar on uplifting black communities 20 trillion and black Americans are poor we've done everything that's been asked you haven't done everything that's been asked though subsidized housing Medicaid public schooling going subsidized College we're talking about2 trillion have been spent on the Great Society and yet Black America is poorer more murderous more dangerous so there's an explanation I'm asking you we are not asking for handouts we are asking for equity and part of equity equity mean you mean taking from other people excuse me it means sharing which is something that you guys seem to have a very hard time doing sharing so somebody has to explain why black America and you haven't is 13% of the population and commits 58% of the murders black people have built and founded the society thank you I was very smart group very opinionate there were a couple other people I kind of felt bad for them they had a lot of strong opinions but they just weren't ready for Prime Time overall very good group very impressive Republicans tend to just focus on like preventing you from arguing your point not actually countering the points that you come up with he often will switch the topic like do a lot of Gish Galloping and like kind of filibustering to get people to not be able to make the points that they want to make and I definitely feel like he did that to me look Charlie's a talented guy there's a reason why he spoke at the RNC he's media trained he's had conversations like this before and he's built a career on dunking on college students but for a bunch of liberal students who don't have that same type of media training and who aren't as prepared to be in confrontational formats like this I thought they did a really good job of our articulating their views yeah Mason was the smartest kid for sure uh Parker needs to calm down very smart but kept on changing the topic uh but he's got talent very annoying though smart but Annoying Parker definitely gave Charlie a run for his money yeah Parker ate Parker ate that down one girl was very nasty she was a very nasty person she overly personalized it I honestly don't regret any of the things I said the only thing I would have taken back is I said at the end I as I walked away I said I hope your daughter can get away from you that one was a dig and that was my bad but honestly in the case of her being a 10-year-old pregnant and he won't let her get medical help that's just wild to me I can't believe that I think the group did very great it's a very hard environment for people to learn in these types of areas but I think it's best that people get involved in debate and entertainment as it helps people grow and critically think in our society I thought it was very valuable I hope people learned something um I think the students were able to refine their arguments and hopefully this gets seen by millions of people where they're able to see what side they land on uh but yeah it's not easy just to stand there be 20 on one but uh only at Jubilee media"
